            <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
            <p>HTML is short for HyperText Markup Language. It is a way to explain to a computer the semantic layout of
                a webpage.</p>
            <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
            <p>CSS is short for Cascading StyleSheet. CSS is used to define the visual look of an HTML page.</p>

            <h2>HTML Basics</h2>
            <h3>What is a tag?</h3>
            <p>
                An HTML tag is either the opening or closing part of an element. Examples of tags are "h2" "h1" or "p".
                Open tags can contain attributes specifiying infoormation about the element. Closing tags contain a '/'.
                Some elements are self-contained.
            </p>
            <h3>What is an element?</h3>
            <p>
                An HTML element is defined by an opening and closing tag (unless the element is self-closing). Elements
                are the components that make up an HTML page, being paragraphs, headings, the body, or links. Some
                elements are in-line, meaning they won't make a new line, others are block elements meaning they will
                create a new line.
            </p>
            <h3>What is an attribute?</h3>
            <p>
                An HTML attribute is placed within an element to add more information to it. Examples include: "for",
                "style", "id", and "class".

            <h2>CSS Basics</h2>
            <h3>What is a selector?</h3>
            <p>
                A CSS indicator of what you are styling. Selectors can focus on: ids, classes, and element.
            </p>
            <h3>What is a class ?</h3>
            <p>
                A class can be applied to an HTML element to specify styling. The advantage of using classes is the
                ability to apply styling to multiple different types of elements.
            </p>
            <h3>What is an ID?</h3>
            <p>

                An ID identifies a unique element. This can be used to find an element later or specify a unique
                styling.
